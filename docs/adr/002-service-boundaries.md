# ADR 002: Service Boundaries

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In a monorepo with multiple microservices, defining clear service boundaries is crucial to maintain modularity, enable independent deployments, and prevent tight coupling. We need to establish guidelines for how services should be organized and communicate.

## Decision

We define the following service boundaries and communication patterns:

### Service Types

1. **Go Services**: High-performance, low-latency services
   - Real-time event ingestion
   - High-throughput streaming
   - System-level operations

2. **Python Services**: Business logic-heavy services
   - Complex data transformations
   - API orchestration
   - Machine learning integrations
   - Compliance workflows

3. **Frontend Services**: User-facing applications
   - React-based SPAs
   - Dashboard and visualization
   - Administrative interfaces

### Communication Patterns

- **Synchronous**: REST APIs over HTTP/HTTPS
- **Asynchronous**: Message queues (Kafka, SQS) for event-driven architectures
- **Inter-service**: Service mesh (future enhancement)

### Ownership

Each service has:
- Its own README with setup instructions
- Independent test suite
- Own deployment pipeline
- Clear API contract

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Shared databases**: Each service manages its own data store
- **Direct imports**: Services communicate only via APIs, not code imports
- **Tight coupling**: Changes in one service should not require changes in others

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear ownership and responsibility
- Independent scalability
- Easier debugging and monitoring
- Ability to use the right tool for each job

### Negative

- More overhead in establishing service-to-service contracts
- Network latency between services
- Potential for duplicated logic across services

## Implementation Notes

- All APIs are versioned (`/api/v1/...`)
- OpenAPI/Swagger specs for REST APIs
- Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint on all services
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
