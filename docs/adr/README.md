# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records documenting significant technical decisions made in this project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help future developers understand why certain choices were made.

## Structure

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Title**: A short, descriptive name
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The issue or problem that needs to be addressed
- **Decision**: What was decided and why
- **Consequences**: The positive and negative outcomes of the decision
