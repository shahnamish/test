# SOC 2 Readiness Narrative

## Executive Summary

The Security, Compliance, and Auditing Framework (SCAF) provides a robust control environment designed to meet SOC 2 Type II requirements across the Trust Service Criteria: Security, Availability, Confidentiality, Processing Integrity, and Privacy. This narrative outlines the implemented controls, monitoring processes, and evidence collection procedures to support SOC 2 examinations.

## Organizational Overview

- **Company Name**: Example Corp Security
- **Control Environment Owner**: Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
- **Primary Systems**: Security services, audit pipelines, secrets management, monitoring stack
- **Audit Period**: Continuous monitoring with quarterly control testing

## Control Environment

### CC1: Control Environment

- Documented security policies approved by executive management (see `security-policies.md`).
- Roles and responsibilities defined in the RBAC matrix (`services/permissions/rbac.py`).
- Security training program with tracking (`employees_missing_training_total` metric).

### CC2: Communication and Information

- Security incidents reported via Alertmanager to stakeholders.
- Policy updates communicated through compliance portal and Slack announcements.
- Regulatory changes monitored by compliance team with quarterly reviews.

### CC3: Risk Assessment

- Annual risk assessment documented in `docs/operations/risk-register.xlsx` (template).
- Continuous vulnerability scanning (`services/vulnerability/scanner.py`).
- Third-party risk assessments for KYC/AML providers documented in vendor register.

### CC4: Monitoring Activities

- Security monitoring via Prometheus and Grafana dashboards.
- Audit log integrity checks executed daily (`scripts/run_audit_demo.py`).
- Control self-assessments logged and reviewed quarterly.

### CC5: Control Activities

- Deployment pipelines enforce security checks (`scripts/run_vulnerability_scan.sh`).
- Access reviews performed monthly using RBAC exports.
- Secrets rotation automated and audited.

## Trust Service Criteria Mapping

| Criteria | Control Reference | Description |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| CC6.1    | RBAC, IAM         | Logical access controls restrict system access |
| CC6.2    | Secrets rotation  | Authentication and authorization managed securely |
| CC6.6    | `encryption-policy.yaml` | Encryption protects data in transit and at rest |
| CC7.2    | Monitoring rules  | Security events detected and analyzed |
| CC7.3    | Audit logging     | Security incidents are tracked and investigated |
| CC8.1    | Change management | Changes follow approval workflow (documented) |
| C1.2     | Data governance   | Confidential data classification and handling |

## Evidence Collection

- **Audit Logs**: Immutable logs stored in S3 with Glacier backups.
- **Access Reviews**: Monthly RBAC export and approval records.
- **Incident Response**: Incident tickets in Jira with post-incident reviews.
- **Monitoring**: Grafana dashboard snapshots and alert history.
- **Policy Acknowledgments**: Employee acknowledgments stored in HRIS.

## Monitoring and Reporting

- Daily SOC2 readiness report to compliance team.
- Weekly security posture review meeting.
- Monthly executive summary with key metrics:
  - `high_severity_vulnerabilities_total`
  - `secrets_rotation_overdue_total`
  - `audit_log_write_failures_total`
  - `encryption_failures_total`

## Continuous Improvement

- Quarterly tabletop exercises for incident response.
- Annual penetration tests with remediation tracking.
- Root cause analysis for all critical security alerts.
