# Incident Response Plan

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose
Provide a structured approach for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents to minimize impact.

### Objectives
- Rapid detection and containment of incidents.
- Effective coordination among stakeholders.
- Preservation of evidence for forensics.
- Continuous improvement of security posture.

## 2. Incident Response Team (IRT)

| Role                   | Primary                | Backup                 | Responsibilities |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Incident Commander     | CISO                   | Deputy CISO            | Overall coordination |
| Security Analyst       | SOC Lead               | Security Engineer      | Monitoring, triage |
| Forensics Lead         | Sr. Security Engineer  | Security Consultant    | Evidence collection |
| Communications Lead    | PR Director            | Legal Counsel          | Stakeholder communication |
| DevOps Lead            | Director of SRE        | Senior SRE             | Infrastructure support |
| Compliance Liaison     | Compliance Manager     | Audit Lead             | Regulatory reporting |

## 3. Incident Lifecycle

### 1. Preparation
- Maintain security tooling: SIEM, EDR, endpoint logging.
- Conduct regular training and tabletop exercises.
- Keep incident response runbooks up to date.
- Ensure contact lists and escalation paths are current.

### 2. Identification
- Monitor alerts from Prometheus/Alertmanager, SIEM, endpoint agents.
- Validate alerts using log data (`services/auditing`).
- Categorize severity (P0â€“P3) and incident type (e.g., malware, insider threat).

### 3. Containment
- Short-term containment: isolate affected hosts, revoke compromised credentials.
- Long-term containment: apply patches, disable vulnerable services.
- Document all actions in the incident ticketing system.

### 4. Eradication
- Remove malicious code or unauthorized access.
- Patch exploited vulnerabilities (`services/vulnerability/scanner.py`).
- Update firewall rules, IAM policies, or configurations as needed.

### 5. Recovery
- Restore systems from trusted backups with TDE enabled.
- Monitor for reoccurrence or residual malicious activity.
- Validate system integrity before returning to production.

### 6. Lessons Learned
- Conduct post-incident review within 5 business days.
- Document timeline, root cause, and corrective actions.
- Update security policies, controls, and monitoring rules.

## 4. Communication Plan

- Initial notification to executives within 1 hour for P0 incidents.
- Legal review before external communications.
- Customer notification in accordance with GDPR/CCPA if personal data involved.
- Regulatory notifications within mandated timeframes (e.g., 72 hours for GDPR).

## 5. Evidence Handling

- Preserve logs, memory dumps, system images.
- Maintain chain-of-custody documentation.
- Store evidence in secure, access-controlled repository.

## 6. Tooling

- **SIEM**: Splunk/Elastic SIEM for log analysis.
- **SOAR**: Automation of containment via security orchestration tools.
- **Forensics**: EnCase, Volatility, `audit_repository` for log retrieval.
- **Ticketing**: Jira/ServiceNow for incident tracking.
- **Communication**: Secure messaging (Signal), dedicated bridge lines.

## 7. Playbooks

### 7.1 Ransomware Attack
- Disconnect affected systems from network.
- Identify strain and propagation vector.
- Restore critical services from offline backups.
- Engage law enforcement if required.

### 7.2 Credential Compromise
- Reset compromised credentials, enforce MFA.
- Review access logs for misuse.
- Rotate associated secrets (`scripts/secrets_rotation_job.py`).

### 7.3 Data Exfiltration
- Identify scope using DLP and network logs.
- Contain data flows (firewall blocks, network segmentation).
- Notify affected customers/regulators.

## 8. Metrics and Reporting

- Mean Time To Detect (MTTD)
- Mean Time To Respond (MTTR)
- Number of incidents by severity
- Control effectiveness (percentage of incidents detected by automated controls)

## 9. Training and Exercises

- Quarterly tabletop exercises focusing on different scenarios.
- Annual full-scale simulation involving cross-functional teams.
- Continuous education via security awareness platform.

## 10. Maintenance

- Reviewed semi-annually by the Incident Response Team.
- Updates triggered by major incidents, system changes, or regulatory updates.
