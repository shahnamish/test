# Security Policies

## 1. Information Security Policy

### Purpose
Establish a comprehensive framework to protect organizational information assets from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

### Scope
All employees, contractors, systems, and data processing environments.

### Policy Statements

- All information assets must be classified according to sensitivity: Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted.
- Access to information assets is granted on a least-privilege basis.
- Security controls are implemented based on risk assessment and asset classification.
- Annual security awareness training is mandatory for all personnel.

### Review Frequency
Annually or upon material changes to the business or threat landscape.

## 2. Access Control Policy

### Authentication Requirements

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for all privileged accounts.
- Passwords must meet complexity requirements (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols).
- Password managers encouraged; password reuse prohibited.
- Session timeouts: 15 minutes idle for privileged sessions, 60 minutes for standard users.

### Authorization

- Access controlled via RBAC system (`services/permissions/rbac.py`).
- Approvals required for elevated access; logged in audit trail.
- Access reviews conducted monthly with automated reminders.
- Termination checklist includes immediate revocation of all access.

### Remote Access

- VPN with MFA for remote administrative access.
- Device compliance checks before granting network access (EDR agent, patching status).

## 3. Encryption Policy

### Data at Rest

- All databases encrypted using Transparent Data Encryption (TDE).
- Filesystems containing sensitive data encrypted with LUKS or BitLocker.
- Encryption keys managed via HSM or KMS with automated rotation.

### Data in Transit

- TLS 1.3 required for all external-facing services.
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) for internal service-to-service communication.
- Certificate management automated via ACME or internal PKI.

### Personal Identifiable Information (PII)

- Field-level encryption for PII fields (SSN, credit card numbers).
- Tokenization for payment card data.
- Key escrow procedures documented in `incident-response-plan.md`.

## 4. Audit Logging and Monitoring Policy

### Logging Requirements

- All authentication events logged (successful and failed attempts).
- All privileged actions logged with immutable audit trail.
- Logs retained for 7 years for compliance.
- Centralized logging via ELK/Fluentd stack.

### Monitoring

- Real-time monitoring of security events via Prometheus/Grafana.
- Alerting configured for anomalies, threats, and compliance violations.
- 24/7 SOC monitoring for critical alerts (via PagerDuty integration).

### Audit Trail Integrity

- Logs protected with checksums and write-once storage (S3 Glacier).
- Log tampering monitored and alerted.

## 5. Incident Response Policy

### Incident Classification

- **P0 Critical**: Data breach, ransomware, systemic compromise.
- **P1 High**: Attempted breach, significant vulnerability exploit.
- **P2 Medium**: Suspicious activity, policy violations.
- **P3 Low**: Informational, minor policy deviations.

### Response Procedures

1. Detection: Automated alerts and user reports.
2. Triage: Security team classifies and assigns priority.
3. Containment: Isolate affected systems.
4. Investigation: Root cause analysis and evidence collection.
5. Remediation: Apply fixes, patches, or configuration changes.
6. Recovery: Restore normal operations.
7. Lessons Learned: Post-incident review within 5 business days.

### Communication

- Executive notification within 1 hour for P0 incidents.
- Customer notification within 72 hours if PII compromised (GDPR compliance).

---

## 6. Vulnerability Management Policy

### Scanning

- Dependency scanning on every build (`scripts/run_vulnerability_scan.sh`).
- Container image scanning before deployment (Trivy, Clair).
- Infrastructure scanning weekly (Nessus, OpenVAS).

### Remediation SLAs

- Critical vulnerabilities: 7 days.
- High vulnerabilities: 30 days.
- Medium vulnerabilities: 90 days.
- Low vulnerabilities: Best effort.

### Exceptions

- Risk acceptance requires CISO approval with documented compensating controls.
- Exception reviews quarterly.

---

## 7. Change Management Policy

- All changes follow documented approval workflow (RFC process).
- Security review required for changes affecting:
  - Authentication/authorization.
  - Encryption configurations.
  - Network security (firewalls, ACLs).
- Emergency changes documented post-implementation.

---

## 8. Data Retention and Destruction Policy

### Retention Periods

- Audit logs: 7 years.
- Security incident records: 7 years.
- KYC/AML records: Regulatory minimum (typically 5-10 years).
- Application logs: 1 year.

### Destruction

- Secure deletion of sensitive data using cryptographic erasure.
- Hard drives sanitized per NIST SP 800-88 before disposal.
- Certificates of destruction maintained.

---

## 9. KYC/AML Compliance Policy

### Know Your Customer (KYC)

- Customer identity verification required before onboarding.
- Enhanced due diligence for high-risk customers.
- Ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity.

### Anti-Money Laundering (AML)

- Transaction monitoring via AML service (`services/kyc_aml/aml_service.py`).
- Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) filed per regulatory requirements.
- Annual AML training for relevant personnel.

### Compliance Integration

- KYC/AML alerts integrated with case management system.
- Audit trail for all KYC/AML decisions.
