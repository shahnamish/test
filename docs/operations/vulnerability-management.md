# Vulnerability Management Program

## Overview

This document outlines the vulnerability management process, including tools, scanning frequency, remediation requirements, and reporting.

## Tools

- **Dependency Scanning**: Safety, Dependabot
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Bandit
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: OWASP ZAP (planned integration)
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy
- **Infrastructure Scanning**: Nessus/OpenVAS (external to this repo)

## Scanning Schedule

| Scanner | Coverage | Frequency |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Safety  | Python dependencies | Daily (CI) + weekly manual |
| Bandit  | Python code | Each pull request |
| Trivy   | Container file systems | Weekly |
| OWASP ZAP | Web application | Monthly or after major releases |
| Nessus/OpenVAS | Infrastructure | Monthly |

## Process

1. **Detection**
   - Automated scans triggered via CI/CD or scripts (`scripts/run_vulnerability_scan.sh`).
   - Findings stored in `reports/` directory with JSON output.

2. **Triage**
   - Security team reviews findings daily.
   - Validate severity and exploitability.
   - Assign to responsible engineering team.

3. **Remediation**
   - Critical severity: fix within 7 days.
   - High severity: fix within 30 days.
   - Medium severity: fix within 90 days.
   - Low severity: best effort.
   - Create Jira tickets with detailed remediation steps.

4. **Verification**
   - Re-run scans to confirm remediation.
   - Update ticket with evidence (scan reports, code changes).

5. **Reporting**
   - Weekly report to Security Steering Committee.
   - Monthly summary to executive leadership.
   - Metrics tracked:
     - Mean Time To Remediate (MTTR)
     - Number of open vulnerabilities by severity
     - SLA adherence rate

## Alerting

- High/critical findings trigger Alertmanager notifications.
- Slack notifications to `#security-alerts` channel.
- PagerDuty triggered for critical vulnerabilities.

## Exception Handling

- Document risk acceptance with justification and compensating controls.
- CISO approval required for SLA exceptions.
- Review exceptions quarterly.

## Continuous Improvement

- Quarterly tool calibration and rules updates.
- Annual penetration testing with findings integrated into remediation backlog.
- Integrate Snyk/Dependabot for automated PRs on vulnerable dependencies.
