# Security, Compliance, and Auditing Framework

A comprehensive framework for enterprise-grade security, compliance, and auditing capabilities.

## Overview

This framework provides:

- **Centralized Auditing**: Track all security-relevant events across services
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Structured logging with ELK/EFK stack integration and Prometheus/Grafana monitoring
- **KYC/AML Compliance**: Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering compliance placeholders
- **Permission Management**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system
- **Encryption**: At-rest and in-transit encryption with key rotation
- **Secrets Management**: Automated secrets rotation and secure storage
- **Compliance Documentation**: SOC2-ready narratives and security policies
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated dependency and container scanning
- **Alerting**: Real-time security and compliance alerts

```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Terraform (for infrastructure deployment)
- kubectl (for Kubernetes deployments)

### Installation

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Start services with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

### Configuration

1. **Logging**: Configure log levels and outputs in `config/logging/`
2. **Monitoring**: Set up Prometheus and Grafana in `config/monitoring/`
3. **Security**: Configure encryption keys and secrets in `config/security/`
4. **Compliance**: Review and customize policies in `docs/compliance/`

## Services

### Audit Service

Tracks all security-relevant events with immutable audit logs.

```python
from services.auditing import AuditLogger

audit = AuditLogger()
audit.log_event(
    event_type="user.login",
    user_id="user123",
    resource="api.example.com",
    action="login",
    result="success"
)
```

### KYC/AML Service

Placeholder integration for customer verification and compliance.

```python
from services.kyc_aml import KYCService

kyc = KYCService()
result = kyc.verify_customer(customer_id, documents)
```

### Permission Service

Role-based access control with fine-grained permissions.

```python
from services.permissions import RBACManager

rbac = RBACManager()
if rbac.check_permission(user_id, resource, action):
    # Authorized
    pass
```

## Compliance

This framework is designed to support:

- SOC 2 Type II
- GDPR
- PCI DSS
- HIPAA
- ISO 27001

Compliance narratives and control mappings are available in `docs/compliance/`.

## Security Features

### Encryption

- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for stored data
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- **Key Management**: Automated key rotation with AWS KMS/HashiCorp Vault integration

### Secrets Management

- Automated rotation schedules
- Secure storage with encryption
- Access auditing
- Integration with Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault

### Vulnerability Scanning

- Dependency scanning (Snyk, Dependabot)
- Container image scanning (Trivy, Clair)
- SAST/DAST integration
- Automated remediation workflows

## Monitoring and Alerting

- **Metrics**: Prometheus for metrics collection
- **Visualization**: Grafana dashboards for security metrics
- **Logging**: ELK/EFK stack for log aggregation
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty, Slack, and email integration
- **Tracing**: Jaeger/Zipkin for distributed tracing

## Deployment

### Docker Compose (Development)

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Kubernetes (Production)

```bash
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes/
```

### Terraform (Cloud Infrastructure)

```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run security tests
pytest tests/security/

# Run compliance tests
pytest tests/compliance/
```
